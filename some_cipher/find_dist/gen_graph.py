"""
Generate a directed graph of changes in states of nibbles in SomeCipher.

To prevent float underflow, the probabilities are expressed in a logarithmic
form, using this formula:

    -log(p)

This ensures that the weights are positive and additive. Hence,the higher the
weight, the lower the probability.
